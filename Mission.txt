I am devoted to the things I choose to do. 
I aim for balance in my life: balancing hard work and relaxation, inside and outdoors, taking responsibility and feeling carefree, 
being a strong woman and being happy like a child. 
People surrounding me inspire me to learn, grow and achieve the best results possible. 
I strive to be in an environment that is coherent with my personal values: honesty, dedication and reliability.
